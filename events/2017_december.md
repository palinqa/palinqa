### Why you should share what you've got - telling tales of testing across the company
__Erik Hörömpöli (Software Tester @ TOPdesk)__

As my company is growing - currently at 17 scrum teams in 3 countries - we are facing the problem of testers in these teams not talking too much to each other. Therefore not sharing enough experience, lessons-learned and especially mistakes. In this talk I will tell you why I think we need to tackle this, what forums do we have for community building, what works and where do we struggle. I'll leave you with some key take-away on why I feel strongly about this topic and hope that you will hear something that you can implement at your organization.

__About Erik:__
Erik fell into testing 5 years ago after finishing sociology studies, worked with consumer finance software in the beginning, now works at TOPdesk. He is interested in understanding systems and the spot where software meets people.
