__[Ingo Philipp](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ingo-philipp-4759399a/) (Distinguished Evangelist at Tricentis)__ 

Stephen Hawking, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk all have one thing in common (besides wealth): they’re all terrified of the so-called AI apocalypse, a hypothetical scenario where highly-intelligent machines become our overlords and exterminate mankind. Will AI also take over software testing? Join this session to explore how AI could assist or replace the human tester in specific software testing use cases. Ingo Philipp will debate the topic, with the ultimate goal of helping you navigate the “AI in software testing” bullshit that’s now common in the marketplace. We want you to walk away prepared to make an informed decision on where AI can truly alleviate your top testing pain points.

### It's Tricky: Chatbots & QA
__[Lina Zubyte](https://www.linkedin.com/in/linazubyte/) (QA Consultant at ThoughtWorks)__

In 2016, as part of a survey run by Oracle regarding tech trends, over 80% of businesses answered that they already have or will implement a chatbot by 2020. A few years passed, the craze for chatbots is not as sky-rocketing, but the trend is still there: more and more businesses are experimenting with chatbots, especially, when it comes to customer-facing services. However, with chatbots comes a huge amount of uncertainty.

Working with a chatbot as a QA, I felt like the traditional methods of testing do not apply as well in this new area. It made me do a lot of research, experiment, and, even build my own chatbot to explore the topic more. In this session, I will share my learnings on chatbots and discuss these questions: What should we think about when we build chatbots? How can we as QAs help to ensure the quality of a chatbot? What in the end is a good quality chatbot? Join me in my talk and get ready for the future of chatbots.
