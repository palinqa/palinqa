## Testing in Production & From Tester to Support Ops

### Testing in Production - Make Your Testing Process More Efficient Without the Risks
__Istv√°n Marhefka (Agile Coach & Software Architect)__

When should we stop the testing of a software? We can try to find new bugs but will those bugs really matter to our customers in the end? Or if we don't find any bugs, how long should we continue testing in the hope that we will find something?

Testing in Production can be a practical answer to these questions in certain software projects.

The talk will be about a real-life software product where we could decrease the delivery cycle from 2 weeks to 1 week and increase the consistency rate of the software (one of our major KPIs that measures the correctness of our system) from 60% to 97% with testing in production within 2 months. We also had to deal with cultural differences in our organisation that came from the traditional mindset of how people were thinking about the testing process in general.

### From Tester to Support Ops: Lessons Learned
__Manuel Schipper (Customer Operations Engineer @ Cloudera)__

In this talk, Manu will talk us through the transformation from working as an automated software tester in distributed systems and hardware, to supporting operations for large-scale data operations and production critical clusters at Cloudera.

Lessons learned, transferable skills, and the great fun that is looking at software from a pessimistic perspective.
