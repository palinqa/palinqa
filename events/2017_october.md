## Introduction to Cynefin

This workshop is not only for testers: a lot of professionals working in Agile (and not only) can benefit from it. It does not require to have a laptop with you. The event will be hosted by Secret Sauce Partners.

Cynefin has been in the center of attention in a tech world recently. You may have heard fragments about it: sense making, complexity theory, thinking patterns, etc. However, what is it actually about?

Cynefin in Welsh means habitat or place. In other words, it is the place of your multiple belongings. This depicts a rather complex system of who we are as people: we are rooted in different places, believe in certain ideas and all of this influences who we are.

All the influences that affect us as people, affect our work as well. This is why it is so important to learn more about thinking patterns and how to deal better with the problems this constantly changing tech world gives us.

In this workshop, we will challenge our own thinking patterns by an exercise in groups which will help us recognize some behaviors we tend to do in certain situations. Then, Lina will give you a brief introduction to Cynefin with some examples. In the end, you should leave with the small foundation of Cynefin Framework theory and its applications.
